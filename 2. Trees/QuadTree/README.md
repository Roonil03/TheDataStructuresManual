# Quad‐Tree Data Structure Documentation

## Overview

A **Quad‐Tree** is a hierarchical data structure for partitioning two‐dimensional space into adaptable, axis‐aligned quadrants. Each node stores a point or region, and recursively divides its area into four child quadrants—Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southwest (SW), and Southeast (SE)—allowing efficient spatial queries such as point location, range search, and nearest‐neighbor search.

## Key Properties

- **Recursive Subdivision**: The plane is subdivided into quadrants at each node, with each non‐leaf node having exactly four children.
- **Adaptive Resolution**: Regions only subdivide when they contain points exceeding a threshold, providing finer granularity where needed.
- **Spatial Locality**: Points geographically close in 2D map to nearby nodes, improving cache performance and query efficiency.
- **Balanced by Content**: Unlike fixed grids, Quad‐Trees adapt their shape to data distribution, avoiding wasted space in sparse areas.


## Core Operations

### 1. Insertion

- Begin at the root covering the entire region.
- If the node is empty and below capacity, store the point.
- If capacity is exceeded, subdivide the node into four quadrants, redistribute existing points into their corresponding child quadrants, and then insert the new point recursively into the appropriate child.
- Runs in *O*(log n) on average for uniformly distributed points, where *n* is the number of points.


### 2. Range Search

- Given an axis‐aligned rectangular query region, traverse from the root:

    1. If the node’s region does not intersect the query, skip it.
    2. If the node is a leaf, test stored points for inclusion.
    3. Otherwise, recursively search child quadrants whose regions intersect the query.
- Efficiently prunes large empty areas, yielding performance proportional to the number of reported points plus the number of traversed nodes.


### 3. Nearest‐Neighbor Search

- Recursively traverse the tree to find the leaf quadrant containing the query point.
- Maintain the best (closest) point found so far and its distance.
- As the recursion unwinds, for each node check whether other quadrants could contain a closer point by comparing the best distance to the distance from the query to the quadrant boundary.
- Search those quadrants if they might improve the result.
- Average complexity is *O*(log n), worst‐case *O*(n) in highly skewed distributions.


### 4. Deletion (Optional)

- Locate the point by traversing down the quadrants.
- Remove it when found; if a node becomes under‐populated and its children are leaves, collapse the subdivision by merging children back into the parent.


## Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Average Time | Worst‐Case Time | Space |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Insertion | *O*(log n) | *O*(n) | *O*(n) |
| Range Search | *O*(r + log n) | *O*(n) | *O*(n + q) |
| Nearest‐Neighbor | *O*(log n) | *O*(n) | *O*(n) |
| Deletion | *O*(log n) | *O*(n) | *O*(n) |

Here, *r* is the number of reported points and *q* is the number of quadtree nodes visited during a query.

## Implementation Details

- **Node Structure**: Each node stores a bounding box, a list of points if leaf, and four child pointers if subdivided.
- **Threshold Capacity**: Choose a maximum number of points per leaf (e.g., 1–4) to balance tree depth vs. node search cost.
- **Subdivision Logic**: On overflow, compute the midpoint of the node’s bounding box on both axes to create four equal quadrants.
- **Memory Management**: Use dynamic allocation for nodes and carefully handle deallocation to prevent memory leaks.
- **Boundary Handling**: Define clear rules for points lying exactly on subdivision lines to ensure deterministic placement.


## Use Cases and Applications

- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**: Efficient spatial indexing of map features for rapid querying and rendering.
- **Computer Graphics**: Accelerating collision detection and view‐frustum culling by spatially partitioning geometry.
- **Image Processing**: Adaptive image compression and hierarchical representation of image regions.
- **Spatial Databases**: Indexing multi‐dimensional spatial records for fast range and nearest‐neighbor queries.
- **Game Development**: Real‐time spatial queries for object management, pathfinding, and occlusion culling.
